# Wayback Analysis

## Assignment Rationale 
Analyze an early website using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) Search for an old version of your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping, etc. Make note of its layout and things that you find surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.

Write a short analysis of your findings, and post it.

Based on your analysis, what norms do we expect websites to have? How Jarring is it to see a site that does not follow these norms? What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user, visiting this outdated site?

## Assignment
**This assignment was done completely by me.*

For this analysis, I revisited an older version of Vogue.com to examine its layout and user experience. Vogue, a high-profile fashion and lifestyle publication, is well known for its modern, visually rich design, which has evolved over the years. However, looking at its earlier iterations reveals a very different approach to web design, one that is surprisingly simplistic and at times, jarring compared to today's expectations for smooth, dynamic websites.

**Layout and Aesthetic**

The older version of Vogue.com (circa early 2000s) is marked by a very basic layout, dominated by text and small images, with little emphasis on interactive or multimedia elements. The homepage featured large blocks of text that were hard to scan quickly, with links mostly in plain fonts. There was a noticeable lack of high-resolution images compared to the site today, and it was far less image-focused, especially given that Vogue is known for its glossy, high-fashion photography. Instead of a sleek and minimalistic design, the older site felt quite cluttered, with sidebars full of links to various sections like fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, making navigation more overwhelming than intuitive.

In terms of colors, the older Vogue website had a very dated look with muted tones and a heavy reliance on text-based navigation. There was little contrast between the background and text, making reading somewhat difficult. The typography, too, was very basic, lacking the modern flair that has since become synonymous with Vogue's identity.

**Functionality and User Experience**

One of the most surprising aspects of this old version was the speed and responsiveness of the site. While modern websites load almost instantly, this earlier version felt sluggish by comparison. Images often required additional loading, and some pages included large pop-ups or advertisements that interrupted the user experience.

Additionally, the navigation was not as fluid as what we see today. There were fewer options for sorting through content, and categories like fashion, beauty, and lifestyle were only accessible via text-heavy dropdown menus. This lack of intuitive design meant that users had to work harder to find the content they wanted, and it was difficult to get a quick overview of the site.

**Surprising Features**

There were several features that stood out as odd, given today’s expectations. For one, the homepage didn’t feature much in the way of social media integration, even though social media platforms were starting to gain prominence. The absence of any interactive elements—like commenting or sharing—was jarring, as those functions are now commonplace across websites, particularly in the entertainment and fashion industries. There was also an overwhelming presence of advertisements, which seemed out of place given Vogue’s brand as a luxury fashion magazine.

**Norms and Expectations for Modern Websites**

Based on this analysis, I’ve identified a few key norms that modern websites are expected to follow:

- **Visually Rich Design**: Modern websites, especially in the fashion and entertainment sectors, need to be visually appealing. This includes high-resolution images, a well-balanced layout, and plenty of white space to allow content to breathe.
- **Fast Load Times**: Visitors expect fast load times. Any delay in the process is a major deterrent, especially with rich media content.
- **Clear and Intuitive Navigation**: Websites must offer a streamlined navigation system that helps users easily find what they’re looking for with minimal clicks.
- **Social Media Integration**: Sharing, commenting, and other forms of social interaction are now staples for most websites, especially for those in the fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle industries.
- **Interactivity and Engagement**: Modern sites encourage users to interact with the content, whether through comments, social media sharing, or other engagement tools.

**Experience as a Modern Internet User**

As a modern internet user accustomed to sleek, fast, and intuitive websites, visiting an outdated site like the early version of Vogue.com felt like stepping back in time. It was almost uncomfortable to navigate, as the site's functionality was slow and clunky. The visual elements, while not entirely displeasing, felt underwhelming and lacked the richness I associate with Vogue today. The overall experience was somewhat frustrating, as I had to work harder to find the content I wanted.

In contrast to today’s [Vogue website](https://www.vogue.com/) which is a hub for high-definition images, video, and interactive content, the old site seemed far less capable of engaging users or offering a dynamic experience. The absence of social media integration was particularly surprising, given how central platforms like Instagram have become to the fashion industry’s digital presence.

In conclusion, websites have evolved significantly over the past decade or so, with major improvements in aesthetics, usability, and speed. Visiting an older version of Vogue.com reminded me just how much expectations have shifted, and how much we take modern web design for granted. For the average user today, encountering such an outdated site would likely be disorienting, but it serves as an interesting reminder of how far digital media has come.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
Select a product to explain how to use it right out of the box (this is a figure of speech--your product does not have to come in a box). This can be a video game console, photo editing software, a smart watch, Instagram, an InstantPot, or anything you'd like. The key is that you are writing to a complete novice: somebody who has no idea what to do. Do not assume that your reader has any prior knowledge about any aspect of your product.

**To Do**
- Use clear, step-by-step instructions that state what to do to begin using the product
- Use at least 3 images or screenshots that illustrate 3 different steps (decorative images of the product or its logo do not count)
- Use easy-to-understand language so that someone who has never heard of your product could successfully complete the process 
- Use tone of a professional tutorial: doesn't sound condescending or too informal
