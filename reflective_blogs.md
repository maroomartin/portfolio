# Wayback Analysis

## Assignment Rationale 
Analyze an early website using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) Search for an old version of your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping, etc. Make note of its layout and things that you find surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.

Write a short analysis of your findings, and post it.

Based on your analysis, what norms do we expect websites to have? How Jarring is it to see a site that does not follow these norms? What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user, visiting this outdated site?

## Assignment
AI Statement: This assignment was done completely by me.

For this analysis, I revisited an older version of Vogue.com to examine its layout and user experience. Vogue, a high-profile fashion and lifestyle publication, is well known for its modern, visually rich design, which has evolved over the years. However, looking at its earlier iterations reveals a very different approach to web design, one that is surprisingly simplistic and at times, jarring compared to today's expectations for smooth, dynamic websites.

![Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2 31 57 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30e9abd7-35e2-41a5-b8c3-599e75582d76)
*Figure 1. Old version of Vogue.com* 

**Layout and Aesthetic**

The older version of Vogue.com (circa early 2000s) is marked by a very basic layout, dominated by text and small images, with little emphasis on interactive or multimedia elements. The homepage featured large blocks of text that were hard to scan quickly, with links mostly in plain fonts. There was a noticeable lack of high-resolution images compared to the site today, and it was far less image-focused, especially given that Vogue is known for its glossy, high-fashion photography. Instead of a sleek and minimalistic design, the older site felt quite cluttered, with sidebars full of links to various sections like fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, making navigation more overwhelming than intuitive.

In terms of colors, the older Vogue website had a very dated look with muted tones and a heavy reliance on text-based navigation. There was little contrast between the background and text, making reading somewhat difficult. The typography, too, was very basic, lacking the modern flair that has since become synonymous with Vogue's identity.

**Functionality and User Experience**

One of the most surprising aspects of this old version was the speed and responsiveness of the site. While modern websites load almost instantly, this earlier version felt sluggish by comparison. Images often required additional loading, and some pages included large pop-ups or advertisements that interrupted the user experience.

Additionally, the navigation was not as fluid as what we see today. There were fewer options for sorting through content, and categories like fashion, beauty, and lifestyle were only accessible via text-heavy dropdown menus. This lack of intuitive design meant that users had to work harder to find the content they wanted, and it was difficult to get a quick overview of the site.

**Surprising Features**

There were several features that stood out as odd, given today’s expectations. For one, the homepage didn’t feature much in the way of social media integration, even though social media platforms were starting to gain prominence. The absence of any interactive elements—like commenting or sharing—was jarring, as those functions are now commonplace across websites, particularly in the entertainment and fashion industries. There was also an overwhelming presence of advertisements, which seemed out of place given Vogue’s brand as a luxury fashion magazine.

**Norms and Expectations for Modern Websites**

Based on this analysis, I’ve identified a few key norms that modern websites are expected to follow:

- **Visually Rich Design**: Modern websites, especially in the fashion and entertainment sectors, need to be visually appealing. This includes high-resolution images, a well-balanced layout, and plenty of white space to allow content to breathe.
- **Fast Load Times**: Visitors expect fast load times. Any delay in the process is a major deterrent, especially with rich media content.
- **Clear and Intuitive Navigation**: Websites must offer a streamlined navigation system that helps users easily find what they’re looking for with minimal clicks.
- **Social Media Integration**: Sharing, commenting, and other forms of social interaction are now staples for most websites, especially for those in the fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle industries.
- **Interactivity and Engagement**: Modern sites encourage users to interact with the content, whether through comments, social media sharing, or other engagement tools.

![Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2 43 51 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d62c7b2b-3c21-45fc-be13-5efde0a57c94)
*Figure 2. New version of Vogue.com* 

**Experience as a Modern Internet User**

As a modern internet user accustomed to sleek, fast, and intuitive websites, visiting an outdated site like the early version of Vogue.com felt like stepping back in time. It was almost uncomfortable to navigate, as the site's functionality was slow and clunky. The visual elements, while not entirely displeasing, felt underwhelming and lacked the richness I associate with Vogue today. The overall experience was somewhat frustrating, as I had to work harder to find the content I wanted.

In contrast to today’s [Vogue website](https://www.vogue.com/) which is a hub for high-definition images, video, and interactive content, the old site seemed far less capable of engaging users or offering a dynamic experience. The absence of social media integration was particularly surprising, given how central platforms like Instagram have become to the fashion industry’s digital presence.

In conclusion, websites have evolved significantly over the past decade or so, with major improvements in aesthetics, usability, and speed. Visiting an older version of Vogue.com reminded me just how much expectations have shifted, and how much we take modern web design for granted. For the average user today, encountering such an outdated site would likely be disorienting, but it serves as an interesting reminder of how far digital media has come.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
Select a product to explain how to use it right out of the box (this is a figure of speech--your product does not have to come in a box). This can be a video game console, photo editing software, a smart watch, Instagram, an InstantPot, or anything you'd like. The key is that you are writing to a complete novice: somebody who has no idea what to do. Do not assume that your reader has any prior knowledge about any aspect of your product.

**To Do**
- Use clear, step-by-step instructions that state what to do to begin using the product
- Use at least 3 images or screenshots that illustrate 3 different steps (decorative images of the product or its logo do not count)
- Use easy-to-understand language so that someone who has never heard of your product could successfully complete the process 
- Use tone of a professional tutorial: doesn't sound condescending or too informal

# Reflective Blog 3

## Assignment Rationale 
Prompt F: Reflect on one of your completed Deliverables for this course. What was easy for you? What was more difficult? Why? What did completing this assignment teach you about yourself and technical communication? What would you do differently based on the instructor's feedback?

## Assignment
AI Statement: Spellcheck was used for this reflection.

Completing the [Quick-Start Guide for ChatGPT](#quick-start-guide) was a valuable learning experience in technical communication. One aspect that was easy for me was using Markdown to format the guide correctly. I felt comfortable structuring the document, incorporating bolded keywords, numbering steps, and linking directly to the appropriate website. Additionally, working with an AI tool to facilitate an overview of Markdown helped streamline the process.

However, some parts of the assignment were more challenging. One difficulty was ensuring that each step was broken down clearly enough for a complete novice while also ensuring there was just enough for context. My professor’s feedback pointed out that some of my steps contained multiple actions, which made them less clear. Also, I initially included an introduction, but I learned that technical writing should get straight to the steps without unnecessary content. Another challenge was making sure that my instructions were self-contained rather than directing users to follow built-in prompts. I also realized the importance of properly captioning images, including citing myself if I took the screenshots.

This assignment reinforced that effective technical communication requires clarity, precision, and attention to detail. Based on the feedback, I would refine my steps further, add an example question for users, and ensure my captions and instructions provide complete guidance.

**Since completing this reflective blog, my Quick-Start Guide has been updated to reflect changes based on feedback and suggestions from my professor and peers.*

### Reflection on Creating the Tread Lightly! Chatbot with Chatling

Creating the [Tread Lightly! Chatbot](https://maroomartin.github.io/portfolio/chatbot.html) using Chatling was an insightful experience that highlighted both the strengths and limitations of AI in content development. As I navigated through this process, I found that AI played a crucial role in streamlining the chatbot’s structure, generating concise information, and maintaining a user-friendly tone. However, I also encountered areas where AI required re-prompting, modifications, and additional oversight.

**What AI Does Well**

AI excels at structuring information efficiently and providing a solid foundation for chatbot interactions. In my case, I used ChatgPT-4o to quickly generated an outline for the chatbot’s purpose, personality, and key functions. It also helped make the conversation flow logical and engaging, ensuring users could navigate the chatbot seamlessly. Additionally, AI helped create consistent language and tone, making the chatbot feel approachable and informative.

Another strength of AI is its ability to summarize large amounts of information into digestible responses. This was particularly useful when integrating Tread Lightly!’s T.R.E.A.D. principles, as AI could break them down into concise, actionable tips for users. All I needed to do was input the knowledge base and it did the rest. 

**What AI Does Not Do Well**

Despite its efficiency, AI has limitations in content accuracy and context-specific knowledge. While it generated relevant responses, I had to verify the accuracy of off-road ethics and conservation principles against official sources like Tread Lightly! and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). AI also struggled with fact-checking and nuanced details, occasionally oversimplifying complex topics or missing key aspects of responsible off-roading. I feel like this is a trainable issue, though, as providing more input and instructional prompts to AI can help mitigate some of the errors.

Another challenge was navigating ambiguous user inputs. AI-generated chatbots often rely on pre-programmed paths, which means they may not handle unexpected or vague questions effectively. I had to adjust the chatbot’s logic to ensure users weren’t left without a response if they asked something outside the scope of Tread Lightly!’s principles.

**What I Had to Modify**

Throughout the development process, I had to re-prompt AI many times to refine responses and structure conversations better. Some key modifications included:

- Clarifying vague AI responses by making the information more specific to Tread Lightly! rather than generic outdoor ethics.

- Rewriting chatbot prompts to ensure they were engaging and user-friendly.

- Adjusting AI-generated explanations to align with official guidelines from Tread Lightly! and environmental agencies.

- Reducing unnecessary details to keep responses concise and relevant for chatbot users.

**Understanding AI’s Training Data**

After starting this project, it became obvious that AI models are trained on large datasets sourced from books, articles, websites, and public domain materials. This means the AI has access to general environmental and ethical outdoor practices, but it does not always have direct access to specific, up-to-date regulations from specialized organizations like Tread Lightly! or BLM unless those sources are publicly available and provided to the AI chatbot for usage. 

Additionally, I learned that AI’s training data tends to favor widely available and mainstream information, which means certain niche topics—such as OHV-specific land use regulations—may be underrepresented or oversimplified.

**The Future of AI in This Field**

As AI technology continues to evolve, I believe we will see significant improvements in:

- More context-aware chatbots that can access real-time data and adapt to new regulations or environmental policies.

- Better user intent recognition, allowing AI to handle more nuanced or unexpected user questions effectively.

- Integration with official databases, enabling chatbots to pull information directly from organizations like Tread Lightly!, BLM, or NPS for up-to-date and accurate responses.

- AI-powered personalization, where chatbots can adapt recommendations based on individual user preferences and previous interactions.

Overall, AI is a powerful tool for content generation and automation, but it still requires human oversight, verification, and ethical considerations to ensure accuracy and reliability. My experience with Chatling reinforced the importance of using AI as an assistant rather than a replacement when creating informational tools like this chatbot.

## Assignment Rationale
Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

## Assignment
AI Statement: I used ChatGPT-4o to analyze and revise my resume. I used Spell Check for my reflection post. 
  
### Resume Revision Reflection  
After submitting my [resume](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19476698/Website.Resume-Mariah.Martin.pdf) to ChatGPT for feedback, I received a detailed and tailored revision that helped me present my experience in a more professional, industry-specific way. The AI suggested formatting updates, clarified my job titles and responsibilities, and restructured the content to emphasize transferable skills relevant to my ideal career paths, which include technical writing, content strategy, and program coordination.

The most impactful changes included:

- A clear professional summary that highlights my strengths and career goals.

- Grouping my skills under core competencies to make them easier to scan for hiring managers.

- Reframing my stay-at-home parenting and entrepreneurship roles to emphasize leadership, communication, project management, and adaptability.

- Adding a Project Highlights section to showcase relevant academic and personal work.

These changes made my resume feel not only more cohesive and polished but also more strategically positioned for the roles I want to pursue. The process helped me realize that my varied experiences, such as parenting, entrepreneurship, public health, and technical writing, can be woven together into a strong professional narrative when presented clearly and confidently.

What I learned is that how I frame my experience matters just as much as the experience itself. I now understand the importance of tailoring my resume toward specific goals and emphasizing impact rather than simply listing tasks. This exercise boosted both my resume quality and my confidence moving forward in my career.
