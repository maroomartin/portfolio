# Wayback Analysis

## Assignment Rationale 
Analyze an early website using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) Search for an old version of your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping, etc. Make note of its layout and things that you find surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.

Write a short analysis of your findings, and post it.

Based on your analysis, what norms do we expect websites to have? How Jarring is it to see a site that does not follow these norms? What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user, visiting this outdated site?

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
