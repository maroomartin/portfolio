    <td>Hey there, I'm Mariah! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where I explore the intersection of technical communication, open-source collaboration, and innovative technology.

As a technical communications student, I thrive on making complex ideas accessible through clear, structured, and engaging content. I love working with:

- Markdown & blogging â€“ Sharing insights and tutorials on ENC4265
- Open-source contributions â€“ Collaborating on projects that make an impact
- Tech & AI â€“ Exploring the latest advancements and integrating them into my work

Whether I'm crafting user-friendly documentation, fine-tuning backend logic, or designing intuitive front-end experiences, Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and learn something new.

ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s Connect! Have a question or want to collaborate? Feel free to reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/maroomartin) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariahtmartin/).</td>
